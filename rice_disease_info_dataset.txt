Bacterial blight is caused byXanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.
It causes wilting of seedlings and yellowing and drying of leaves.
The disease is most likely to develop in areas that have weeds and stubbles of infected plants.It can occur in both tropical and temperate environments, particularly in irrigated and rainfed lowland areas. In general, the disease favors temperatures at25−34°C, with relative humidity above 70%.
It is commonly observed when strong winds and continuous heavy rains occur, allowing the disease-causing bacteria to easily spread through ooze droplets on lesions of infected plants.
Bacterial blight can be severe in susceptible rice varieties under high nitrogen fertilization.
Check for wilting and yellowing of leaves, or wilting of seedlings (also called kresek).
On seedlings, infected leaves turn grayish green and roll up. As the disease progresses, the leaves turn yellow to straw-colored and wilt, leading whole seedlings to dry up and die.
Kresek on seedlings may sometimes be confused with early rice stem borer damage.
To distinguish kresek symptoms from stem borer damage,squeeze the lower end of infected seedlings between the fingers. Kresek symptoms should show yellowish bacterial ooze coming out of the cut ends.Unlike plants infested with stem borer, rice plants with kresek are not easily pulled out from soil.

Bacterial blight is one of the most serious diseases of rice. The earlier the disease occurs, the higher the yield loss.
Yield loss due to bacterial blight can be as much as 70% when susceptible varieties are grown, in environments favorable to the disease.
When plants are infected at booting stage, bacterial blight does not affect yield but results in poor quality grains and a high proportion of broken kernels.
Planting resistant varieties has been proven to be the most efficient, most reliable, and cheapest way to control bacterial blight.

Blast is caused by the fungusMagnaporthe oryzae.It can affect all above ground parts of a rice plant: leaf, collar, node, neck, parts of panicle, and sometimes leaf sheath.
Blast can occur wherever blast spores are present.
It occurs in areas with low soil moisture, frequent and prolonged periods of rain shower, and cool temperature in the daytime. In upland rice, large day-night temperature differences that cause dew formation on leaves and overall cooler temperatures favor the development of the disease.
Rice can have blast in all growth stages. However, leaf blast incidence tends to lessen as plants mature and develop adult plant resistance to the disease.
Check the leaf and collar for lesions:
Check for other symptoms:
Blast lesions can commonly be confused with Brown Spot lesions.
Leaf blast lesions are usually elongated and pointed at each end, while brown spot lesions tend to be more round, brown in color and have a yellow halo surrounding the lesion.
Rice blast is one of the most destructive diseases of rice. A leaf blast infection can kill seedlings or plants up to the tillering stage. At later growth stages, a severe leaf blast infection reduces leaf area for grain fill, reducing grain yield.
Leaf blast can kill rice plants at seedling stage and cause yield losses in cases of severe infection.
The primary control option for blast is to plant resistant varieties. Contact your local agriculture office for up-to-date lists of varieties available.
Other crop management measures can also be done, such as:
Silicon fertilizers (e.g., calcium silicate) can be applied to soils that are silicon deficient to reduce blast. However, because of its high cost, silicon should be applied efficiently.Cheap sources of silicon, such as straws of rice genotypes with high silicon content, can be an alternative.Care should be taken to ensure that the straw is free from blast as the fungus can survive on rice straw and the use of infected straw as a silicon source can spread the disease further.
Systemic fungicides like triazoles and strobilurins can be used judiciously for control to control blast. A fungicide application at heading can be effective in controlling the disease.

Brown spot has been historically largely ignored as one of the most common and most damaging rice diseases.
Brown spot is a fungal disease thatinfects the coleoptile, leaves, leaf sheath, panicle branches, glumes, and spikelets.
Its most observable damage is the numerous big spots on the leaves which can kill the whole leaf.When infection occurs in the seed, unfilled grains or spotted or discolored seeds are formed.
The disease can develop in areas with high relative humidity (86−100%) and temperature between 16 and 36°C. It is common in unflooded and nutrient-deficient soil,or in soils that accumulate toxic substances.
For infection to occur, the leaves must be wet for 8−24 hours.
The fungus can survive in the seed for more than four years and can spread from plant to plant through air. Major sources of brown spot in the field include:
Brown spot can occur at all crop stages, but the infection is most criticalduring maximum tillering up to the ripening stages of the crop.
Check for lesions:
On susceptible varieties, lesions are5−14 mm long which can cause leaves to wilt. On resistant varieties, the lesions are brown and pinhead-sized.
Lesions on leaf sheaths are similar to those on the leaves. Infected glumes and panicle branches have dark brown to black oval spots or discoloration on the entire surface.
Spikelets can also be infected. Infection of florets leads to incomplete or disrupted grain filling and a reduction in grain quality. The disease-causing fungi can also penetrate grains, causing'pecky rice',a term used to describe spotting and discoloration of grains.
In certain rice varieties, brown spot lesions can be mistaken forblast lesions. To confirm, check if spots are circular, brownish, and have a gray center surrounded by a reddish margin.
Brown spot causes both quantity and quality losses.
On average, the disease causes 5% yield loss across all lowland rice production in South and Southeast Asia. Severely infected field can have as high as 45% yield loss.
Heavily infected seeds cause seedling blight and lead to 10−58% seedling mortality.It also affects the quality and the number of grains per panicle, and reduces the kernel weight.
In terms of history, Brown spot was considered to be the major factor contributing to theGreat Bengal Faminein 1943.
Improving soil fertility is the first step in managing brown spot. To do this:
Fertilizers, however, can be costly and may take many cropping seasons before becoming effective.More economical management options include:

Rice tungro disease is caused by the combination of two viruses, which are transmitted by leafhoppers. It causes leaf discoloration, stunted growth, reduced tiller numbers and sterile or partly filled grains.
Tungro infects cultivated rice, some wild rice relatives and other grassy weeds commonly found in rice paddies.
Tungro disease viruses are transmitted from one plant to another by leafhoppers that feed on tungro-infected plants. The most efficient vector is the green leafhopper.
Leafhoppers can acquire the viruses from any part of the infected plant by feeding on it, even for a short time. It can, then, immediately transmit the viruses to other plants within 5−7 days. The viruses do not remain in the leafhopper's body unless it feeds again on an infected plant and re-acquires the viruses.
Tungro infection can occur during all growth stages of the rice plant. It is most frequently seen during the vegetative phase. Plants are most vulnerable at tillering stage.
Tungro incidence depends on the availability of the virus sources and vectorpopulation. Other than infected rice plants in the farmer's field, other primary sources for tungro, include:
Seedlings raised in nurseries or seedbeds can also be infected with Tungro prior to transplanting and can be a primary source of virus.
Transplanting seedlings from nurseries in tungro-infected areas has also shown to increase infection rates in the field, particularly, in cases where seedbed is in a tungro-endemic area or when the nursery duration is 5−6 weeks.
However, this is not believed to be a very strong mechanism in initiating epidemics, because the competitiveness of tungro-infected seedlings is low; they can die rapidly after transplanting.
Tungro is one of the most damaging and destructive diseases of rice in South and Southeast Asia.In severe cases, Tungro susceptible varieties infected at an early growth stage could have as high as 100% yield loss.
Once tungro is present in the field, it increases rapidly in young rice plants. Leafhopper vectors prefer to feed on young rice plants. They also acquire tungro viruses more efficiently from younger infected plants.
Check for presence of leafhoppers.
Check leaves for discoloration.
Yellow or orange-yellow discoloration is noticeable in tungro-infected plants. Discoloration begins from the leaf tip and extends down to the blade or the lower leaf portion. Infected leaves may also show mottled or striped appearance, rust-colored spots, and inter-veinal necrosis.
Tungro-infected plants also show symptoms of stunting, delayed flowering which may delay maturity, reduced number of tillers, small and not completely exserted panicles, as well as a higher than normal percentage of sterile panicles or partially filled grains, covered with dark brown blotches.
The degree of stunting and of leaf discoloration varies with rice varieties, strains of the viruses, the age of the plant when infected, and with the environment. In varieties that carry some resistance to the disease, infected plants exhibit no discoloration or only a mild discoloration that may disappear as the plants mature.
Tungro symptoms can be mistaken for physiological disorders.
Specifically,
Where available, Tungro can be confirmed using serological tools such as Latex agglutination test, Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) and Rapid Immunofilter Paper Assays (RIPA).
Once a rice plant is infected by tungro, it cannot be cured.
Preventive measures are more effective for the control of tungro than direct disease control measures. Using insecticides to control leafhoppers is often not effective, because green leafhoppers continuously move to surrounding fields and spread tungro rapidly in very short feeding times.
